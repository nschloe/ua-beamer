\begin{abstract}
This is a theme for the \LaTeX{} \texttt{beamer} class for presentations. It has been designed to  match the official UA templates for Microsoft PowerPoint\textsuperscript{\textregistered} while doing away with some of the shortcomings of it within the \texttt{beamer} framework. If you would like to give a scientific presentation with all the benefits you get from using \LaTeX{}, this theme is for you.\footnote{Note that there exists another \texttt{beamer} theme for the Universiteit Antwerpen designed by \textsc{Kris Ven} \cite{Ven::BTU}, which has many more options than this package. In contrast to this theme, it is not designed with compliance to the official themes in mind.}

% Moreover, as of this writing, it is not known to the author whether or not that theme is still being made available for download.
